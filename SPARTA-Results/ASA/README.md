# ASA

This folder contains SPARTA testing results for components printed using **ASA** (Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate) filament materials.

## Organization
- Each filament brand and model should have its own subfolder (e.g., `Polymaker_ASA`).
- Part-specific test results are organized under brand/model folders.

## Notes
- Only include parts printed primarily in ASA.
- Follow all SPARTA reporting, naming, and structure standards.
