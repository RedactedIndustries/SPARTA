# PAHT-CF

This folder contains SPARTA testing results for components printed using **PAHT-CF** (High-Temperature Carbon Fiber Reinforced Nylon) filament materials.

## Organization
- Each filament brand and model should have its own subfolder (e.g., `Qidi_PAHT-CF`).

## Notes
- PAHT-CF is rated for higher thermal and mechanical loads â€” environmental and live-fire testing should account for this.
- Standard SPARTA reporting and structure required.
