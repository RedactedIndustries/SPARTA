# PA12 Nylon

This folder contains SPARTA testing results for components printed using **PA12 (Nylon 12)** filament materials.

## Organization
- Each filament brand and model should have its own subfolder (e.g., `Polymaker_PA12CF`).

## Notes
- PA12 offers higher moisture resistance compared to PA6 â€” note this if relevant during environmental testing.
- Full SPARTA standards apply.
