# NylonX

This folder contains SPARTA testing results for components printed using **NylonX** (carbon fiber reinforced nylon) filament materials.

## Organization
- Each filament brand and model should have its own subfolder (e.g., `MatterHackers_NylonX`).

## Notes
- Only include parts printed with carbon fiber reinforced Nylon blends branded as NylonX or equivalents.
- SPARTA testing procedures must be followed precisely.
