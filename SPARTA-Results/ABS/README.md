# ABS

This folder contains SPARTA testing results for components printed using **ABS** (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) filament materials.

## Organization
- Each filament brand and model should have its own subfolder (e.g., `Hatchbox_ABS`).
- Test results are organized by part type under brand/model folders.

## Notes
- Only include parts printed primarily in ABS.
- Ensure proper documentation and compliance with SPARTA standards.
