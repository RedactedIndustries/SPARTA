# Polycarbonate (PC)

This folder contains SPARTA testing results for components printed using **Polycarbonate (PC)** or **PC Blends**.

## Organization
- Each filament brand and model should have its own subfolder (e.g., `Polymaker_PC-Max`).

## Notes
- Only include parts printed primarily in PC or PC-based blends.
- Be sure to document environmental factors clearly, as PC can be humidity-sensitive.
