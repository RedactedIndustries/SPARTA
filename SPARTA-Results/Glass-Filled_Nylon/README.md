# Glass-Filled Nylon

This folder contains SPARTA testing results for components printed using **Glass-Fiber Reinforced Nylon** filament materials.

## Organization
- Each filament brand and model should have its own subfolder (e.g., `3DXTech_GlassNylon`).

## Notes
- Only include parts printed primarily with glass-filled or glass-reinforced nylon materials.
- Document increased stiffness and brittleness if observed during mechanical and drop testing.
- Full SPARTA documentation standards apply.
