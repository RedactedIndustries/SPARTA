# PLA+

This folder contains SPARTA testing results for components printed using **PLA+** filament materials.

## Organization
- Each filament brand and model should have its own subfolder (e.g., `eSun_PLA+`).
- Part-specific results go inside brand/model folders.

## Notes
- PLA+ is evaluated primarily for **prototyping and baseline comparisons**, not for full structural applications unless otherwise noted.
- Follow all SPARTA testing and reporting standards.
