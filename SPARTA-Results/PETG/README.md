# PETG

This folder contains SPARTA testing results for components printed using **PETG** (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol-modified) filament materials.

## Organization
- Each filament brand and model should have its own subfolder (e.g., `Overture_PETG`).
- Test results organized under brand/model and part type.

## Notes
- Only include parts printed primarily in PETG.
- Full SPARTA documentation and reporting standards apply.
