**Standardized Printed Arms Resilience Testing and Assessment**

---

## Overview

SPARTA is an open, community-driven framework for the standardized testing of 3D-printed firearm components produced using filament-based additive manufacturing (FDM/FFF).  
It provides structured methodologies for evaluating material durability, mechanical resilience, dimensional accuracy, environmental endurance, and live-fire operational performance.

SPARTA exists to support responsible builders, developers, and researchers in advancing the safety, reliability, and innovation of 3D-printed firearm technologies.

---

## Key Objectives

- Define realistic, accessible, repeatable testing standards.
- Enable credible material and design evaluations without requiring industrial equipment.
- Foster transparent, verifiable data collection and sharing.
- Support the growth of resilient additive manufacturing practices within the 3D2A community.

---

## Core Testing Areas

SPARTA defines methodologies for:

- Dimensional Accuracy Testing
- Mechanical Load Testing (Tensile, Flexural, Compression)
- Drop and Impact Resistance Testing
- Environmental Exposure Testing (UV, Heat, Cold, Humidity)
- Live-Fire Operational Testing

Each area is designed to be executable with hobbyist or prosumer-grade equipment while maintaining professional documentation standards.

---

## Community Collaboration

SPARTA is built and maintained by the community. Contributions are welcomed and encouraged, including:

- Submission of structured testing results
- Proposals for new testing procedures
- Expansion to new materials, manufacturing methods, or component types
- Continuous improvement and refinement of the standard

To contribute, please follow the **Submission Guidelines** below and use the standard repository organization and file naming conventions defined in the [SPARTA Charter](https://github.com/RedactedIndustries/SPARTA/blob/main/SPARTA_STANDARD/SPARTA%20-%20Standardized%20Printed%20Arms%20Resilience%20Testing%20and%20Assessment.pdf) (link to be added when published).
